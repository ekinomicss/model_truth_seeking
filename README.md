# Truth-seeking with models 


For my curiosity, comparing different methods to help models approach truth:

- **debate:** models argue opposing sides of a topic, allowing them to challenge each otherâ€™s claims and refine responses
- **collaborative inquiry:** models explore a topic together, where each model contributes perspectives
- **falsification:** prompt the model to generate claims on a topic, then actively seek counterexamples using the model itself
- **empirical:** model predicts outcomes based on data or facts, then compares its responses to real-world data or established knowledge
