# Truth-seeking with models 


Curiosity project: comparing different methods to help models approach truth:

currently, building some model eval utils for fast experimentation. applications will include

- **debate:** models argue opposing sides of a topic, allowing them to challenge each otherâ€™s claims and refine responses
- **collaborative inquiry:** models explore a topic together, where each model contributes perspectives
- **falsification:** prompt the model to generate claims on a topic, then seek counterexamples using the model itself
- **empirical:** model predicts outcomes, then compares its responses to real-world data/knowledge
